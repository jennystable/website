Jenny was an amazing person! She was all about family, friends, and bringing people together.  She loved entertaining.  If she found out someone was alone during a holiday, he or she was invited to her home.  Jenny could always fit one (two, three...) more around her table.  There was always room at Jenny's table.  Everyone was made to feel welcome and special.  "The more the merrier!"

Jenny Cramer passed away from breast cancer in 2018.

We wanted to remember and honor her life in a significant way.  Thus, Jenny's Table was created.

The idea of Jenny's Table is to gather around the table at your home, at a restaurant, at a bar or at the venue of your choice with other women to catch up, pass along information, share stories and experiences, and network, while raising money for women's causes, many of which are underfunded.

It is our hope that you will work with us through Jenny’s Table to plan an event that supports our mission.

## How Jenny’s Table works:

1. Choose a charity (non-religious, non-political) and the minimum amount for each person to donate in order to attend the event.  The charity you choose must be a 501(c)3. 

2. Decide on your guest list, the time and the place of the event.

3. Decide on the food (potluck, hostess-supplied, restaurant, or donated food).

4.  You decide how big or intimate you want your event to be.  (It can be 5 people or 50+ people.  Whatever you decide.)

5. As the hostess, you are responsible for the table settings if needed (tables, chairs, etc.).

6. Jenny's Table accepts no money. **ALL** of the donations will go directly to your chosen 501(c)3 charity with no funds being used for administrative costs, including food, set ups, etc. All checks must be written out to your charity of choice.  

## What we do for you:

1. We give you the use of our trademarked logo.  

2. We can help set up your donation page through your charity of choice.  If there is no page, we will arrange for the monies to go directly to the charity.

3. We can help you with invitations and organizing your event.

3. We can help you keep track of the money raised for your event.

4. We are here to help make your event a huge success.  Therefore, please use the form below or contact us through our website www.jennystable.org or by email at jennystable2018@gmail.com.  We'll be happy to answer any questions and help in any way we can.  Even if you don't need our help, please send us information about your event, the charity and how much you have raised so we can add your event to the Jenny's Table goal.  

## About our first event:

Since the Breast Cancer Research Foundation gives the largest percentage of its funds to research, Jenny's Table chose this charity as the beneficiary of its first fundraiser.

Jenny's Table has no administrative costs; 100% of the monies raised will go directly to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.
