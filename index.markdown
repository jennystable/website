Jenny was an amazing person! She was all about family, friends, and bringing people together.  She loved entertaining.  If she found out someone was

alone during a holiday, he or she was invited to her home.  Jenny could always fit one (two, three...) more around her table.  There was always room at Jenny's table.  Everyone was made to feel welcome and special.  "The more the merrier!"

Jenny passed away from breast cancer in 2018.

We wanted to remember and honor her life in a significant way.  Thus, Jenny's Table was created.

Our mission is to raise money for women’s causes, by having women come together, while enjoying food and each other’s company.

It is our hope that you will work with us through Jenny’s Table to plan an event that supports our mission.

## How Jenny’s Table works:

1. Choose a charity (non-religious, non-political) and the minimum amount for each person to donate in order to attend the event.

2. Decide on you guest list, the time and the place of the event.

3. You decide on the food (potluck, hostess-supplied, or donations)

4. As the hostess, you are responsible for the setup (table settings, tables, chairs, etc.)

5. ALL of the money will go directly to the charity with no funds being used for administrative costs, including food, etc.

## What we do for you:

1. We set up your donation page through your charity of choice.  If there is no page, we will arrange for the monies to go directly to the charity.

2. We help you with invitations and organizing your event.

3. We can help you keep track of the money raised for your event.

4. We are here to help make your event a huge success.

## About our first event:

The Breast Cancer Research Foundation gives the largest percentage of their funds to research. Therefore, Jenny's Table has chosen this charity as its first fundraiser.

Jenny's Table has no administrative costs; 100% of the monies raised will go directly to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.
