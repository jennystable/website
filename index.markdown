Jenny was an amazing person! She was all about family, friends, and bringing people together.  She loved entertaining.  If she found out someone was alone during a holiday, he or she was invited to her home.  Jenny could always fit one (two, three...) more around her table.  There was always room at Jenny's table.  Everyone was made to feel welcome and special.  "The more the merrier!"

Jenny Cramer passed away from breast cancer in 2018.

We wanted to remember and honor her life in a significant way.  Thus, Jenny's Table was created.

The idea of Jenny's Table is to gather around the table at your home, at a restaurant, at a bar or at the venue of your choice with other women to catch up, pass along information, share stories and experiences, and network, while raising money for women's causes, many of which are underfunded.

It is our hope that you will work with us through Jenny’s Table to plan an event that supports our mission.

## How Jenny’s Table works:

1. Choose a charity (non-religious, non-political) and the minimum amount for each person to donate in order to attend the event.

2. Decide on your guest list, the time and the place of the event.

3. Decide on the food (potluck, hostess-supplied, restaurant, or donated food).

4. As the hostess, you are responsible for the table settings, tables, chairs, etc.

5. ****ALL**** of the donations will go directly to your chosen charity with no funds being used for administrative costs, including food, set ups, etc.

## What we do for you:

1. We set up your donation page through your charity of choice.  If there is no page, we will arrange for the monies to go directly to the charity.

2. We help you with invitations and organizing your event.

3. We help you keep track of the money raised for your event.

4. We are here to help make your event a huge success.

## About our first event:

Since the Breast Cancer Research Foundation gives the largest percentage of its funds to research, Jenny's Table chose this charity as the beneficiary of its first fundraiser.

Jenny's Table has no administrative costs; 100% of the monies raised will go directly to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.
